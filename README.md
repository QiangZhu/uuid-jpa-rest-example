# JPA/EclipseLink UUID primary key example

Example project for demonstrating the use of UUIDs as primary keys in JPA.

## Special Features

The UUID is not na√Øvely serialized as String, but into a 16-byte array.
It is using the [Java Uuid Generator](https://github.com/cowtowncoder/java-uuid-generator)
library for generating Version-1 UUIDs.

Although not directly related to UUID persistence, this project also applies EclipseLinks load-time
weaving, when spring-instrument.jar is present.

## How to run

On the command-line run `./gradlew bootRun` and open a browser at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
